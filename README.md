# PracticalApplication3_Module17
The goal of this project is comparing the performance of classfication model (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines). The data set that we using are Portuguese banking institution from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This is the Comparisons between every model, from the table we can see that the highest accuracy using the Logistic Regression and the decision tree has 100% accuracy for training accuracy.

This is the comparison after adjusting the model, from the table we can see that the highest accuracy using the Decision tree so decision tree will be the most effective mode for this dataset.
